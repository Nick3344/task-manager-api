# Task Manager API

Task Manager API built with Flask, supporting user authentication and task management.

The Task Manager API is designed to provide a robust backend solution for managing tasks efficiently. Built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, it leverages Flask-RESTful for creating RESTful APIs and Flask-JWT-Extended for secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This API allows users to register accounts, securely log in, create, update, retrieve, and delete tasks. With integrated Swagger documentation, developers can easily explore endpoints, understand request formats, and test functionality directly through a user-friendly interface. Whether you're looking to integrate task management capabilities into your application or explore Flask-based API development, this project serves as a solid foundation.
